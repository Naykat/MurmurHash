# MurmurHash
MurmurHash is a family of non-cryptographic hash functions that are designed to be fast, efficient, and produce high-quality hash values.

MurmurHash is a general-purpose hash function that can be used for a wide range of applications, including hash tables, checksums, and data fingerprinting. It is designed to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for use in high-performance applications where speed is critical.

MurmurHash uses a combination of bitwise operations, multiplication, and shift operations to generate hash values. It is designed to produce hash values that are uniformly distributed and have good avalanche properties, meaning that changing a single bit in the input should result in a completely different hash value.

MurmurHash comes in several variants, including 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit versions. Each variant is optimized for a specific use case and provides a different balance of speed, efficiency, and hash quality.
